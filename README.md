# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview 

Using Credit Card data this project compares two machine learning models that reduce bias and is best able to predict credit risk. Using over and under sampling methods and comparing both to see which is best for a company to use for their lending standard practices. 

## Results 

- **Naive random oversampling**

- **SMOTE oversampling**

## Summary 

Comparing all of the different models of both over and under sampling the data. The model that is best able to predict a credit risk and that predicted credit risk to actually be a true positive is the Ensemble Adaboost classifier. The precision and recall for this model average at 96%. Which is a very good threshold for ensuring that majority of risks are caught by the model and that when they are caught these are true risks and not false positives.
